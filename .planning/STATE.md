## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10-phase structure derived from 45 requirements across 8 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel (CTO/AppSec agents depend on Phase 2, not Phase 3)
- [Roadmap]: SDLC Lead Agent placed in Phase 6 (not Phase 1) because it orchestrates specialists that must exist first
- [01-02]: Agent directory at agents/ (project root) not .claude/agents/ -- prioritizes version control and portability over auto-discovery
- [01-02]: SDLC-v2 stored in agents/shared/ as read-on-demand file, not inlined in agent system prompts
- [01-02]: Default subagent config: sonnet, 25 maxTurns, Read/Grep/Glob/Bash tools
- [01-02]: Maximum 2 re-spawns per subagent task before escalation
- [01-01]: All 12 governing principles apply in spirit; 8 fully, 3 simplified, 1 (radical traceability) deferred to Growth
- [01-01]: CEO accepts High/Critical residual risk (not CTO/CISO split) because CEO covers CISO responsibilities at Startup
- [01-01]: All 7 agents start at Trust Level 2 (Supervised Autonomous); promotion requires 30+ interactions + CEO approval
- [01-01]: IEA maps to PR-based workflow at Startup; 9 v2 components collapse to agents + PR review + CI/CD + Git history
- [01-01]: Focus on 8-9 standards/frameworks at Startup; defer 21+ to Growth/Enterprise
- [01-01]: Simplified risk register schema (~15 fields in YAML-in-Git, not 50+ field full schema)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: ISO 42001 auditor expectations are poorly documented (standard is 2 years old) -- engage certification body in Week 1
- [Research]: NorthGRC is the GRC platform (not Vanta as research suggested) -- integration patterns may differ
- [Research]: TISAX scope change assessment needed -- previous scope may not match new HH Group scope
- [Research]: 12-week timeline rated MEDIUM confidence -- CEO review bottleneck is primary risk
